# Memory-Game-Beta-
A really simple game played directly in the c# console.

The game displays one out of three possible outputs: |¤| | |, | |¤| | or | | |¤|
This repeats for as many times as the selected level.
Then it's your turn to repeat the output in the correct order
Use the left, down and right arrow key to do this
If you do it correctly you clear the level, if you fail the program tells you that it's wrong
