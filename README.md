# Memory Game
A really simple game played directly in the c# console.

The game displays one out of three possible outputs: |¤|  |  |, |  |¤|  | or |  |  |¤|
<br>
This repeats for as many times as the current level.
<br>
<br>
Then it's your turn to repeat the output in the correct order.
<br>
Use the left, down and right arrow key to do this.
<br>
<br>
If you do it correctly, you clear the level and can continue on the next.
<br>
If you fail, you will see your final score and the level will be set to 1
